# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of analysis
We have been recuited by PyBer to explore the relationships between type of city, number of riders, number of drivers, and fare rates and percentages. PyBer's goal is to improve access to their ride sharing service and determine the affordability of those services in underserved neighborhoods. By assessing the relationships between the number of riders, drivers, and comparing the average rates between city types we will be able to help PyBer improve their strategy and cater to the needs of Urban, Suburban, and Rural Cities. 


## Results
The results generated in our initial exploration on the differences between fares and the number of drivers and riders for each city type showed a large disparity between Rural and Urban cities. 

Urban Cities had the highest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares when compared to the other city types. Urban Cities actually had more drivers than they had rides. Because of this,  Urban Cities had the a much lower average fare per ride and average fare per driver. This is likely the result of having so many drivers available in these areas. Even though Urban Cities tend to have a greater need for more drivers and more rides, each ride is not very profitable for the driver when compared to drivers in smaller city types. 

Suburban Cities had the secong highest amount of total rides, drivers, and total fares. However, it is still a pretty significant difference when comparing them to larger cities. Suburban cities had more total rides than total drivers, but not by a huge margin. This seemed to level out the difference between the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. 

Rural Cities as expected has the least number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. Because Rural areas have smaller population sizes, the demand for  ride sharing services is less. The total fares for the Rural cities was a fraction of the total fares generated from Suburban and Urban areas. Again, this is not a huge surprise because the number of rides are also much less when compared to the other city types. When comparing the average fare per ride between rural cities and suburban cities, there is not a huge difference. Perhaps the biggest disparity we observed for rural areas is the average fare per driver. It appears driving in these areas is much more profitable than it is for drivers in rural and suburban areas. This is likely due to the fact that the lower number of drivers overall controls for competition. 

Even though there were some pretty surprising differences in the fare averages for each city type, the trend of fares seem to follow a similar pattern in the early months of the year. There was a spike observed in the fares for all three city types at the end of February. The Urban fares appear to fluctuate more than the other two city types during the month of March.

## Summary
- Recommendation 1: Try to level out the number of drivers relative to the demand for rides in each of the areas, especially urban cities. Although the large number of drivers keeps the fare rates low, it might be difficult for those drivers who are working to turn a profit with all the competition between them. This will hopefully level out the large disparities in the fare rates when comparing them to other areas. 

- Recommendation 2: Launch further investigation into what factors are behind the spike in total fare for all three city types in late February. This coulf give us more insight in the other factors that contribute to the demand for rides and the effect on profitability. If we could isolate the reason for seeing more profits during that time period, they could use that information to try and boost sales at some of the slower times.  

- Recommendation 3: Further investigate why the total Urban fares are fluctuating so much more between the months of March and April while the Suburban and Rural total fares and remaining more consistent.
